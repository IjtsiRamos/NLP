## Introduction

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and human languages. This repository provides a set of NLP functions and techniques implemented in Python, including vocabulary creation, vectorization, similarity calculations, and probabilistic methods.

## NLP Techniques

### Vocabulary Creation

- **create_vocabulary**: Create a vocabulary from a list of documents.
- **create_vectorized_document**: Create a vectorized representation of a document based on a vocabulary.
- **create_matrix_documents**: Create a matrix of vectorized documents using a vocabulary.
- **calculate_cosine_similarity**: Calculate cosine similarity between two vectors.
- **calculate_similarity_for_query**: Calculate document similarity for a query using cosine similarity.
- **sort_dictionary_by_value**: Sort a dictionary by values in descending order.

### Ranking Methods

- **create_vocabulary2**: Create a vocabulary for ranking methods.
- **create_vectorized_document2**: Create a vectorized document for ranking methods.
- **create_matrix_documents2**: Create a matrix of vectorized documents for ranking methods.
- **calculate_similarity_for_query2**: Calculate document similarity for a query using ranking methods.

### Probabilistic Methods

- **create_vocabulary3**: Create a vocabulary for probabilistic methods.
- **create_vectorized_document3**: Create a vectorized document for probabilistic methods.
- **create_matrix_documents3**: Create a matrix of vectorized documents for probabilistic methods.
- **calculate_similarity_for_query3**: Calculate document similarity for a query using probabilistic methods.

### Probabilistic Methods 2

- **create_vocabulary4**: Create another vocabulary for an alternative probabilistic method.
- **create_vectorized_document4**: Create a vectorized document for the alternative probabilistic method.
- **create_matrix_documents4**: Create a matrix of vectorized documents for the alternative probabilistic method.
- **calculate_similarity_for_query4**: Calculate document similarity for a query using the alternative probabilistic method.
